## Gameplay

The objective of the game is to control the snake, represented by a series of connected blocks, and guide it to eat apples while avoiding collisions with its own body. The snake grows longer with each apple it eats, making it progressively challenging to maneuver. The game continues indefinitely, allowing the snake to pass through boundaries and reappear on the opposite side.

2. Control the snake's movement using the arrow keys (up, down, left, right) on your keyboard.
3. Guide the snake to eat apples by moving it over them.
4. Avoid colliding with the snake's own body.
5. As the snake eats apples, it grows longer, increasing the challenge.
