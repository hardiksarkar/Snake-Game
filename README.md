# Snake Game

Welcome to the Snake Game! This classic game is implemented in Java using Java Swing for the graphical user interface.

## Gameplay

The objective of the game is to control the snake, represented by a series of connected blocks, and guide it to eat apples while avoiding collisions with its own body. The snake grows longer with each apple it eats, making it progressively challenging to maneuver. The game continues indefinitely, allowing the snake to pass through boundaries and reappear on the opposite side.

## How to Play

1. Launch the game by running the `SnakeGame` class.
2. Control the snake's movement using the arrow keys (up, down, left, right) on your keyboard.
3. Guide the snake to eat apples by moving it over them.
4. Avoid colliding with the snake's own body.
5. As the snake eats apples, it grows longer, increasing the challenge.
6. Keep playing to achieve a high score by eating as many apples as possible.
